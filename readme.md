# Cloud web-app deployment
The application should:

	•	Display a list of manhwa titles, their genres, and brief descriptions using mock data (e.g., a JSON file).
	•	Be hosted on a cloud platform (AWS, Azure, or GCP) with a basic infrastructure setup, including:
	•	An EC2 instance or an App Service for hosting.
	•	A storage solution like S3 (AWS) or Blob Storage (Azure) for storing images.
	•	A basic database (e.g., RDS or Cloud SQL) for managing the manhwa data.
	•	Set up auto-scaling for your application so it can handle traffic spikes. Document how auto-scaling is configured and what triggers it (e.g., CPU usage).
	•	Implement security measures by:
	•	Enabling HTTPS for the application using a cloud service (e.g., AWS Certificate Manager or Azure SSL).
	•	Configuring basic firewall rules to restrict access to necessary ports.
